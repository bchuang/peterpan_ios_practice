Create a Tabbed Project

Default "Main.storyboard" include 3 Scene and 2 Segue

    [Scene]
    1.Tab Bar Controller
    2.First View Controller
    3.Second View Controller
    [Segue]
    1.Relationship Segue  "view controllers" to "First"
    2.Relationship Segue  "view controllers" to "Second"

It looks very clear and simple for switch view by using tab bar(footer)
